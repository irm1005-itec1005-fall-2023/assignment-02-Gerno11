      <p>The Roman Empire was the post-Republican state of ancient Rome. It included territory around the
        Mediterranean in Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, and was ruled by emperors. The adoption of
        Christianity as the state church in 380 and the fall of the Western Roman Empire conventionally marks the end
        of classical antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Period of Kings (625-510 BC)</h3>
      <p>The Period of Kings was the first period in Roman history, lasting from the establishment of Rome until 510 BC.
        During this brief period, Rome advanced militarily and economically, with growth in territorial limits, military
        prowess, and manufacture and sale of goods such as oil lamps. Politically, the early building of the Roman
        constitution occurred during this period. The decline of Etruscan dominance marked the end of the Period of
        Kings,
        ushering in Rome's Republican Period.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3 class="yeat">Republican Rome (510-31 BC)</h3>

      <p>In 510 BC, Rome began its Republican Period. The Romans constructed a new type of governance in which the top
        classes, particularly the senators and equestrians, or knights, governed. In times of crisis, though, a dictator
        may be nominated. The Romans constructed the "Twelve Tables," a uniform system of laws for public, private, and
        political issues, in 451 BC.</p>

      <p> During the Republican Period, Rome expanded farther, eventually gaining control of the whole Italian peninsula
        by
        338 BC. The Punic Wars, which lasted from 264 to 146 BC, as well as some battles with Greece, enabled Rome to
        seize control of Carthage and Corinth and thus become the main maritime force in the Mediterranean.</p>

      <p> Soon after, Rome's political climate pushed the Republic into anarchy and civil conflict. This resulted in the
        appointment of a dictator, L. Cornelius Sulla, who ruled from 82 to 80 BC. Following Sulla’s resignation in 79
        BC,
        the Republic returned to a state of unrest. While Rome remained a Republic for another 50 years, the transition
        to
        Imperialism began in 60 BC, when Julius Caesar rose to power.</p>

      <p> By 51 BC, Julius Caesar had conquered Celtic Gaul, and Rome's borders had expanded beyond the Mediterranean
        region
        for the first time. Although the Senate remained Rome's ruling body, its power was dwindling. Julius Caesar was
        slain in 44 BC, and his heir, Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (Octavian), took his place. In 31 BC, Rome
        conquered
        Egypt, killing Mark Antony and establishing Octavian as Rome's unrivalled ruler. Octavian took the title
        Augustus
        and so became Rome's first emperor.</p>

      <h3 class="yeat">Imperial Rome (31 BC – AD 476)</h3>
      <p>The Imperial Period in Rome was its final, lasting from the ascension of Rome's first emperor in 31 BC through
        the destruction of Rome in AD 476. Rome saw several decades of peace, wealth, and expansion throughout this
        time.
        By AD 117, the Roman Empire had expanded to encompass three continents, including Asia Minor, northern Africa,
        and
        the majority of Europe. </p>

      <P>The Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western empires in AD 286, each headed by its own emperor. The
        western empire was subjected to multiple Gothic invasions and was sacked by Vandals in AD 455. After then, Rome
        continued to deteriorate until the Western Roman Empire collapsed in AD 476. The Byzantine Empire, also known as
        the Eastern Roman Empire, lasted until the 15th century AD. In AD 1453, Turks took control of its capital city,
        Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, Turkey).</p>
